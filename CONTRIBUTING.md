### Introduction

- For building we have used Maven
- Any current issues which need fixing can be found here: [issues](https://github.com/AnnaMariaDimareli/Java2/issues)
  - contributing to a current issue is greatly appreciated

### Are you imagining something new? Is there something that doesn't work?

Make sure to create a issue! A team member will surely be happy to assist and discuss it

### Do you need some ideas?
#### Here are a couple of future ideas we have for the project for inspiration
 - Serialising all users-post-messages in to files before the program exits and then un-serialising the upon launch
 - Using a SQL database as a backend instead of files
 - Splitting it into client and server for online usage
